Final Project Idea: 

I want to build a AI-Powered website that helps people with the tax filing. 
The general workflow is: The users will input their personal info such as their residence, working status, age, etc, then our AI will look into these info and generate a tax plan that our users shall follow. 

To be specific,there will be generated:
- A step by step tax plan for the user.
- A list of all the government forms needed to be done by the user. 
- And a "filing center", where user can drag a form (pdf) for our AI to access and provide guidiance on.
